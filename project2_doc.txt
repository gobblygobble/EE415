None for argument passing.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

We used strtok_r () to change all spaces to '\0'. While doing so, we saved all the
argument tokens' starting address on file_name in start_process ().
And while we copy the tokens into stack with strlcpy (), we keep updating
the args[] array indices to the stack addresses.
Afterwards, after word-aligning and pushing 0 into argv[argc], we pushed the addresses
stored in args[], so that the order would fit.
In the end, of course, we pushed in the argv address, argc, and a fake return address.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

By using strtok_r (), we may call the functions from multiple threads simultaneously,
thus being able to call this function without taking into account synchronization
problems that may arise while using this function.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

File descriptors are unique integers associated with files.
In our implementation, fd_table in struct table both maps and helps link 
the fd with the index of fd_table.
While 0 and 1 are reserved for strin and stdout, respectively.
The rest of the fd (2 to 127 in our implementation) are unique
within a single process, because it is stored in struct thread.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

When an interrupt is issued, we are given the interrupt frame of the process
that was interrupted.
In here we have the esp of the process, so that we can access the stack
of the process that was running before the current one.
While doing so, we always check if the pointer we will access,
or may possibly access is a valid one.
We may also access the eax register in the interrupt frame, so we are able
to 'return' a value to the previous process, in functions that do not 'return',
like exit () that needs to store its status, but is not suppoed to actually return.

For 4,096 bytes of data, the maximum number is the worst case when all bytes
are apart from each other, therefore pagedir_get_page () may have to be called
up to 4,096 times. In the best case, one page is just enough to handle the 4KB,
so the number of calls to pagedir_get_page () is minimum 1 and maximum 4,096.

(If the data is continuously formed, like an array, the maximum number would be 1)

For 2 bytes, similarly, the maximum number of calls to pagedir_get_page ()
is 2 times, with the least number of calls being 1 time.

To improve theese numbers, we may try to allocate data like arrays in the same page,
as much as possible.
By doing so, when a system call tries to copy some user data to a kernel, they will
be likely be close together, (in the same page for the happiest case) and thus
the maximum numbers calling pagedir_get_page () would be significantly decreased. 

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

By making use of semaphores, when a child dies, it calls sema_up () so that
when the parent tries to wait for the child, parent's sema_down () will not make
the parent go to sleep.
However, if the sema_up () hasn't been called in the child because it did not die
yet, the parent will go to sleep so that it will successfully wait for the child
to exit.

Every time we receive a pointer from the user, we check if it lies in
a valid address space (From 0x08048000 to 0xc0000000 aka PHYS_BASE).
Next, we check if the given pointer was mapped into physical address.

If it does not meet at least one of the conditions, we call exit () system call.
Then the system call exit () frees all the resources.

If the user program tries to access a bad pointer, such as NULL pointers or kernel
memory space, the problem is handled at page_fault (), by checking if the exception
was called by a user program. If it was, then we simply call exit (-1) and that
guarantees proper resource freeing.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable

>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

In struct thread, we added 'bool loaded' and 'struct semaphore loaded_sema'.
After load () is called, we store its return value in 'loaded'.
Then we call sema_up () on 'loaded_sema' so that the parent can finally check
the child thread's 'loaded' value to see if it has been successfully loaded or not.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you

>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

We ensured proper sycnrhonization by the use of semaphores.
If P calls wait (C) before C exits, P tries to sema_down on a 0-value semaphore,
therefore going to sleep.
It is woken up when C calls sema_up () right before it exits completely.
If it is called after C exits, P tries to sema_down on a 1-value semaphore.
Then nothing special happens and wait () returns.
All resources are ensured to be freed properly, because exit () takes care of them.
If the parent died without waiting for the child, then when child tries to exit,
it will call exit right away. But this is not supposed to cause any problems.


---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

We used checking address, because it is a lot simpler
than managing in page_fault ().

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

We have a number limit of 128 (126 excluding stdin and stdout) on the
maximum number of files opened at once. Also, it may take up more space
than may need to.
However, the implementation of this array-based is easy, and
is much faster in fetching the file from the given fd than a list-based approach.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

We left them untouched.
