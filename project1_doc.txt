Instead of calling thread_yield (), we first set the time for the thread to wake up,
and then insert the thread to the sleeping element list.
Afterwards, we do thread_block () and then set interrupt levels to their original values
via intr_set_level (old_level).
By blocking the interrupts, we hope to achieve atomicity in the possibly critical section.

Instead of yielding the thread, we block it, and add it to the sleeping list.
Thus, we do not busy wait.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

In next_thread_to_run (), we call list_sort to sort the list in increasing priority order,
and then pop the thread element with highest priority using list_pop_back ().

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

If a donation is supposed to take place, we first update the lock's holder's max_waiter,
and then call the function donation ().
Inside donation (), we check if the lock's holder thread is NULL to avoid errors.
(It is supposed to be NULL if the lock is not held. Thus, no donation should take place when so.)
If it is NULL, we instantly return, since no donation should take place.
Then, if the priority of the lock's holder thread is smaller than the priority of the
lock's holder thread's max_waiter thread, we update the lock's holder thread's donated_priority
to that of the higher priority.
(If it is not, then we should do nothing or just return. In our code, we have written nothing after
the "if () {}", so that the function will automatically exit.)
Afterwards, we perform donation () with the holder thread's waiting_lock.
(The condition for the next donation to happen is that the holder thread's waiting_lock is not NULL.
Because if it is NULL, there is no more donation to occur.)
Hence, with this recursive call, we keep going until there is no need to donate.
After returning from the first donation (), we perform sema_down (), and when sema_down () returns,
we set lock's holder thread to the current thread with thread_current ().
If lock's semaphore's waiting thread list is empty, we set lock's max_waiter to NULL, since there are no waiting threads.
We thene insert the lock into the current thread's lock_list, ordered, via list_insert_ordered ().
Lastly, we set the current thread's maximum waiter thread to point to the above lock_list's waiting thread with the maximum priority.

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to

We've thought of multiple designs, but concluded to use this one.
Knowing the which locks a thread holds, and which threads wait on a lock
helps to clear the code, given that we've handled them properly.
Also, recursive calls of donation () and donation_rb () helps us write more complex
and messier algorithms in a simpler way.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
